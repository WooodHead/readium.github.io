<p>The Readium Projects primary goal is to provide rock-solid, performant building blocks and applications for EPUB3 publications.  There are currently three separate projects  underway: ReadiumJS, Readium SDK and SCP (Secure Content Protection).
<h3>ReadiumJS</h3>
<p>

The ReadiumJS project is developing a JavaScript library and viewer for EPUB 3 rendering optimized for use to render EPUB files directly from websites and in browser-based "cloud" readers. Using ReadiumJS does not require any server-side infrastructure or browser plug-ins. ReadiumJS shares common JS modules with the Readium SDK project which targets native apps. 
</p>
<p>There are two parts to ReadiumJS:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A Readium Chrome Extension which is  available  from the Chrome Web Store. It is one of the most full-featured EPUB 3 Reading Systems available.  The curent version, released 1 May 2015, is 2.18.1.</li>
  <li>A cross-browser (as opposed to a Chrome Extension) implementation (known as the CloudReader) based on essentially the same sources but with a different viewer/application front end.  </li>
  </ul>
<p> In addition, all of the source code for both the Chrome Extension and the CloudReader can be downloaded from github as source code and modified to suit. All of the ReadiumJS sub-projects are available under the BSD open source license</p>
<h3>Readium SDK</h3>
<p>The Readium SDK project is  developing a compact, performant EPUB 3 rendering engine optimized for  use in native apps for tablets and other devices. The Readium SDK Core  C++ library is cross-platform and implemented largely in native code  with some JavaScript/Java/C# implementations where appropriate.</p>
<p>Note that the Readium SDK Core C++ library is dual-licensed: publicly via <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html">Gnu Affero General Public License Version 3</a> (a license which contains terms incompatible with use in closed-source software including a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft">copyleft</a> provision), and via a an <a href="http://readium.org/about-us/corporate-documents/readium-sdk-license">Alternative License</a> based on the <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">Apache License</a> which  provides additional rights targeted to commercial adopters utilizing  Readium SDK in closed-source software, including not having any copyleft  provision. For more information on Readium SDK licensing see: <a href="http://readium.org/license-readium-sdk">http://readium.org/license-readium-sdk</a></p>
<h3>SCP</h3>

          <p>Several members of Readium Foundation are pursuing, as a sub-project of Readium SDK, an implementation of a  DRM technology. Readium SCP (for &quot;Secure Content Protection&quot;) is expected to provide a   module for Readium SDK as well as server-side components. Readium  SDK will not require use of Readium LCP, which will be separately  licensed to interested parties. </p>
          <p>An initial specification proposal for Readium LCP was contributed by Kobo and is available <a href="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/896638/Kobo-EPUB-LCP.pdf">here</a>. More information on Readium LCP coming soon.</p>
