<p><em>Note: We are currently reviewing and revising our planning approaches, so this page is a work-in-progress.</em>
<h3>General Approach
</h3>
<p>The planning process for Readium is an adaptation of the Agile development workflow. However, Agile works very well where one has one or more small teams and the cooperation between the teams and management is tight. A large, global open-source project like Readium, however is definitely not highly, tightly linked.The contributors are distributedd all over the globe and who, exactly is working on the project at any given time varies widely - and sometimes isn't known in advance.</p>
<p>In consequence, we have adopted some parts of the Agile approach and skipped others - and it is all applied flexibly to account for the highly distributed nature of the team and its members. What we do  do includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A prioritized backlog. 
    <ul>
      <li>Readium's is based on Trello but is currently rather out-of-date. This is being worked on real-time.</li>
      <li>Due to the nature of Readium, there are in fact two backlogs:
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://trello.com/b/FtslcLy7/readium-sdk">Readium SDK</a>, which includes the Launchers</li>
          <li><a href="https://trello.com/b/mdx405yR/readiumjs">ReadiumJS</a>, which includes the shared-js layer as well as both the Chrome Extension and the CloudReader</li>
          </ul>
      </li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Issue Tracking
    <ul>
      <li>This is done via the Github issue tracker for each of the repos in Readium.</li>
      <li>Due to the complex nature of Readium and its projects (7 major platforms, many browsers, etc.) there are many different places where issues get tracked.</li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Sprint-based development
    <ul>
      <li>We aim to keep our sprints and releases on the order of 3-4 weeks, but again due to the highly varied resources and timing sometimes the sprints are 5-6 weeks or even more on occasion.</li>
      <li>Since the number, identities and amount of time available from the contributors is rarely known with any certainty, the decisions on what bugs need to be fixed and which features get priority is a rather <em>ad hoc</em> process.</li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  </ul>
<h3>Project Management</h3>
<p>Overall priorities for the Readium project and its sub-projects are set by the Readium board, based on feedback and discussions with the members of the foundation. WIthin these guidelines, Readium project management (Ric Wright, Director of Engineering and other key contributors decide on an actual development plan on a sprint by sprint basis. Every attempt is made to keep this an open and transparent process and we encourage any and all contributors to participate in the process, where appropriate.</p>
