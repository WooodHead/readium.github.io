## Recent Releases

### Readium 0.26

Readium.org is pleased to announce that 0.26 version of Readium has been released.  This release was pushed 3 May 2017.

This release of Readium SDK and ReadiumJS (Chrome Extension and Cloud Reader) is a relatively significant release for the SDK as it comprises all the changes and improvements needed to integrate multiple DRM schemes, including Readium LCP.

The tag for this release is 0.26 on GitHub. 

#### Improvements and Enhancements in this Release
##### Readium SDK
The primary change in the SDK is addition of support for Readium LCP and other DRM schemes. For more information about LCP, please see the FAQ here.  To be clear, this release does not include the release of LCP itself but comprises the changes made to the SDK to enable app developers to integrate one or more DRMs, such as LCP or Sony’s URMS with applications based on Readium. These changes are primarily in the ContentModule and ContentFilter architecture. For developers not using those facilities the impact of these changes should be small or non-existent.
However, as part of these changes there were also non-trivial changes to the Gradle-based build processes for Android. This includes a requirement to be using Android Studio (as Eclipse is officially deprecated by Google). Developers should be using the latest build of Android Studio, which is 2.3.1 at the time of this release. This release is also compatible with the “experimental Gradle plugin” which enables debugging into C++ in addition to Java.
##### Cloud Reader/Chrome App
There are no new features in the Chrome App or the Cloud Reader. However, the release of Google Chrome v. 57 on March 9 “fixed” a previous security hole in its browser extensions framework. The result is that nline-script (JavaScript embedded in an EPUB page) will no longer function in the Readium Chrome app, due to tighter Content Security Policy checks. Instead, an exception is thrown when an inline script attempts to execute. It is still possible to write scripts that will work in the EPUBs, but they have to be written in a specific way compatible with Chrome extensions’ CSP.
For more information about the security protocol and how to write compliant JavaScript interactivity, see this article. An extensive discussion of the issue in the readium-js-viewer repository can be found here. The issue includes links to both invalid and valid EPUBs. For more information, please contact Ric Wright directly.
Note!  This security protocol does NOT affect the CloudReader, only the Chrome app. The CloudReader execution of inline JavaScript is not affected.


### Readium 0.25

Readium.org is pleased to announce that 0.25 version of Readium has been released.  This release was pushed 2 February 2017.

This release, 0.25, has one significant feature in the Chrome Extensions and number of minor improvements in both the Chrome App and the Cloud Reader - as well as a large number of bug fixes.

In the SDK, thep primary change in the SDK is addition of support for XCode 8. We also exposed more metadata via the JNI layer in the Java. Finally, we eliminated a potential security hole related to XML Entity declarations.

The new feature in the Chrome Extension is the capability and UI to allow users to change the font-face for a given document.  In particular the OpenDyslexic font is now an option as well as a sans-serif font and a serif font.  There is no capability for users to add new fonts. The CloudReader has the same feature to allow users to change fonts, plus a few more available (web) fonts.

In addition, there were a fair number of bug fixes.

The complete release notes can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OBBCrjWNOrhFmZRN9z37sd2_SXV_n6NVARLf43-MroM/edit#heading=h.qtxpy4mgkpwz).

### Release of Readium 0.24

Readium.org is pleased to announce that 0.24 version of Readium has been released.  This release was pushed 16 August 2016.

This release, 0.24, is a new release that has one significant feature in the Chrome Extensions and number of minor improvements in both the Chrome Extension and Cloud Reader - as well as a large number of bug fixes.

In the SDK, there were a number of minor bug fixes, plus the removal of some obsolete libraries (OpenSSL for Android and Boos).

The new feature in the Chrome Extension (which is NOT in the Cloud Reader) is the support for importing more than one file at a time. Multiple files can be added via drag and drop onto the library pane or via the normal “Add File” dialog. Once the import has started, the user CAN cancel the import process but the file being imported when the cancel button is pressed will still be imported but subsequent queued files will not be imported.

In addition, there were two regressions in the previous releases:

- An experimental highlighting plugin was inadvertently included in the previous 2.23 build. While this is a nice feature, it is not yet complete - there’s no way to save the highlights. We are working on this but have no ETA when it will be available (volunteers are welcome).
- Navigation using the TOC was not working correctly for TOC items that were not top level (i.e. sub-headers). This is now fixed in this release.

### Release of Readium - 0.23

Readium.org is pleased to announce that 0.23 version of Readium has been released.  This release was pushed 10 June 2016.

This release, 0.23, is a new release that is has one major change and a number of minor improvements - as well as a large number of bug fixes, primarily affecting CFI/navigation. The major change is that we have switched Android build support from Eclipse (now deprecated) to Android Studio (currently 2.1). We also enabled (experimental) support for debugging from Java into C++ (see release notes for more info). Also, HTTP header caching has been enabled which can provide significant performance improvements for some resource-heavy EPUBs.

There are also some minor UX improvements to the Chrome Extensions. Finally, a subset of OPDS support was added to the CloudReader (it was experimental before). You can see a demonstration of it [here](https://readium-master.surge.sh/).
